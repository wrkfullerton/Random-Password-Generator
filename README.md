# Random-Password-Generator

This application is a random password generator which creates a randomly generated secure password for you to use anywhere you would like (on the web or elsewhere).


# How does it work?

To generate a password you must answer a series of prompts, such as the desired character length (8 to 128), or whether you would like your new password to include lowercase, uppercase, numbers, or any special characters.

After you have answered these prompts, the application will generate your password to match the criteria. 

It will displayed within the page for you to copy into the desired location. 

We hope that this application serves you well and protects you from HACKERS!
